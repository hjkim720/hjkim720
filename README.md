<summary>📊 13th MOTIE Public Data Utilization Idea Contest — <b>Grand Prize (Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Award)</b></summary>

- [Competition Link](https://datacontest.kr/)
- [GitHub Link](https://github.com/hjkim720/MOTIE_Data_Contest/)  
- **Role:** Team Leader  
- **Project:** Correction of weather forecast errors caused by the distance between prediction and observation points  
- **Goal:** Improve day-ahead (24-hour) weather prediction accuracy for industrial sites (solar power, gas turbines), enabling better operational safety and combustion stability  
- **Model:** Ensemble of **XGBoost** (capturing structured patterns via GBDT) + **MLP** (capturing nonlinear & latent patterns)  
- **Achievement:** **Grand Prize (산업통상자원부 장관상)** for excellence in data utilization and industrial impact  
</details>

<details>
<summary>💳 SSAFY Big Data Project — <b>Excellence Award (Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.)</b></summary>
  
- **Project:** [FinCoach](https://github.com/fincoachService) - AI-powered financial coaching service (Credit card delinquency prediction & spending pattern improvement recommendation service based on user MyData)
- **Role:** DA & DE
- **Duration:** 2025.08 ~ 2025.10  | Team of 6 (FE 2, BE 2, Data 2)

**Key Achievements:**
- **Realistic MyData generation pipeline (DE):** Combined AI HUB financial synthetic data + Statistics Korea household survey data, reflecting age-specific spending patterns with individual preference-based diversity using the principle "individuals behave uniquely, groups follow statistics"
- **Credit card delinquency prediction model (ML):** HistGradientBoostingClassifier-based model with **46 engineered features** (13 personal info + 33 monthly derived variables including early/mid/late-month spending ratios, credit/debit ratios, 7 major category amounts/ratios, average transaction size, weekend/night spending ratios, HHI, entropy, 3-month rolling, EOM prediction, etc.)
- **Spending habit improvement recommendation system:** Hybrid CF + CBF approach using cosine similarity to extract top 5% similar users, analyzing 4 comparative perspectives: (1) current month vs similar users (2) 3-month average vs similar users (3) current month vs last month (4) current month vs personal 3-month average
- **FastAPI-based prediction/recommendation API:** Developed endpoints for delinquency prediction and spending comparison recommendations with real-time MySQL integration

**Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, FastAPI, pydantic, MySQL

**Acheivement:** **Excellence Award (우수상)** from Samsung Electronics

<summary>📦 DACON Smart Warehouse Shipment Delay Prediction AI Competition — <b>3rd Place / 607 Teams</b></summary>

- [Competition Link](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236696/overview/description)
- [Code Share](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236696/codeshare/13991)
- **Project:** Predicted the average shipment delay over the next 30 minutes for AMR-based smart logistics warehouses (regression, metric: **MAE**)
- **Approach:** Built **545 EDA-driven features** and a **5-model ensemble** (XGBoost L1/Quantile, MLP, Dilated CNN, Bidirectional Transformer), fused via MAE-optimized weighted averaging
- **Core idea — Scenario-level priors:** Trained a separate LightGBM to predict each scenario's overall mean & max delay, then injected those predictions as **leakage-free fold-aligned OOF features** into the row-level models. This passed scenario-wide difficulty down as a prior — and became the single strongest feature-importance signal, the main driver of the final score.
- **Robust validation:** Stress-stratified GroupKFold (4-axis load score) to keep high-load scenarios balanced across folds while preventing scenario leakage
- **Achievement:** **3rd Place out of 607 Teams** (solo participation)

<summary>🌦 KMA 2025 Weather Data Contest — <b>Finalist, Honorable Mention</b></summary>

- [Competition Link](https://bd.kma.go.kr/contest/main.do)  
- **Project:** Predicted subway congestion levels using time-series weather and observational data  
- **Reasoning:** Dataset had numerous categorical variables, outliers, and missing values → CatBoost was more effective than specialized time-series models in this case  
- **Model:** **CatBoost** (robust for categorical features, missing values, and outliers)  
- **Achievement:** **Finalist & Honorable Mention**
